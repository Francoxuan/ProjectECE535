# ProjectECE535
## Motivation
In modern cities, traffic issues have consistently been a vexing challenge. Urban traffic congestion, accidents, and traffic violations pose significant problems for city residents and traffic management authorities. To address these issues, we need an intelligent and efficient means to monitor and manage traffic violations. Concurrently, with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded technologies, we have the opportunity to apply these advanced technologies to traffic management to enhance urban traffic safety and efficiency. The license plate recognition system is a pivotal tool in modern traffic management as it automates the recognition of vehicle license plates, assisting law enforcement agencies in swiftly and accurately tracking vehicles involved in violations, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing traffic infractions.
## Design Goals:
1. Building Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and U-Net Models
2. Testing the Accuracy of the Two Models for License Plate Recognition
3. Comparing the Accuracy Results between the Convolutional Neural Network and U-Net Models
4. Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for user access
## Deliverables: 
1. Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and U-Net model.
2. Project report.
## System Blocks:
1. License Plate Localization Module: Responsible for identifying the coordinates of the license plate in the image
2. Convolutional Neural Network Construction Module: Building the CNN model
3. U-Net Construction Module: Building the U-Net model.
4. Model Testing Module: Evaluating the recognition accuracy of both models for license plate numbers.
5. Graphical User Interface Presentation Module: Providing a graphical interface to the users.

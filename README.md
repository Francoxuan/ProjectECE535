# ProjectECE535
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to address the existing bottleneck issues in the current data processing system. The current system exhibits inefficiency in handling high-frequency data, failing to meet the demands of rapidly growing data requirements. As a result, we plan to design and develop a high-performance data processing system with the aim of improving data processing efficiency, supporting multi-threaded operations, implementing access control, and ultimately providing a superior user experience.
## Design Goals:
1. Real-time Capability: One of the design goals of the project is to ensure real-time processing and display of data to meet users' demands for quick 
   data access.
2. Concurrency: The project is dedicated to achieving multi-threaded concurrent processing to enhance system performance and response time.
3. Security: Permission control and role management are implemented to ensure data security and privacy protection.
4. Scalability: The design goal includes support for future scalability to accommodate the ever-growing data requirements.
5. User-Friendliness: The system should be user-friendly to ensure effective utilization by a variety of users.
## Deliverables: 
1. A complete high-frequency data processing and display system, including both front-end and back-end components.
2. Archives of source code and documentation to ensure maintainability and scalability of the project.
## System Blocks:
1. Data Collection Module: Responsible for collecting data from various sources and transmitting it to the system.
2. Data Processing Module: Conducts data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation for further analysis and display.
3. Data Presentation Module: Provides a user interface for users to search, view, and analyze data.
4. Multi-threaded Processing Module: Handles concurrent requests to ensure high system performance.
5. Permission Control Module: Manages user permissions to ensure data security.
## Hardware/Software Requirements:
1. Server Hardware: Servers with sufficient processing power and storage capacity.
2. Operating System: An operating system that supports multi-threaded processing, such as Linux or Windows Server.
3. Database: A database system for data storage and management, MySQL 
4. Programming Language: The programming language used for developing the system, Java.
5. Front-end Framework: A front-end framework for building the user interface, such as React or Angular.
6. Security Tools: Security tools for implementing permission control and data encryption.

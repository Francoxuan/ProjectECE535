# ProjectECE535
## Project Description
When dealing with a large amount of data in a community forum, especially when it comes to efficiently handling hot data, using conventional methods can lead to inefficient results, increase system load, and degrade user experience. Therefore, we can consider employing a range of optimization strategies, such as data categorization, multi-level caching, and multi-threaded concurrency, to address this issue.
Firstly, data should be categorized to distinguish between hot data and non-hot data. Hot data typically refers to frequently accessed data, such as popular posts or recent comments.
Next, you can consider implementing a multi-level caching system. This means storing data in different tiers of caches for rapid access. Hot data can be stored in a high-speed cache closer to the application, while less frequently accessed data can be stored in lower-level caches. This can significantly improve data access efficiency and reduce the burden on the server.
Furthermore, using multi-threading for concurrency processing is also an effective approach. Allowing multiple threads to process requests simultaneously can speed up data retrieval and presentation. However, ensure that you consider thread safety and synchronization issues when handling data in a multi-threaded environment to avoid potential problems.
In conclusion, these optimization strategies can help you handle a large amount of data in a community forum more efficiently, improve system performance, and provide a better user experience.
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to address the existing bottleneck issues in the current data processing system. The current system exhibits inefficiency in handling high-frequency data, failing to meet the demands of rapidly growing data requirements. As a result, we plan to design and develop a high-performance data processing system with the aim of improving data processing efficiency, supporting multi-threaded operations, implementing access control, and ultimately providing a superior user experience.
## Design Goals:
1. Real-time Capability: One of the design goals of the project is to ensure real-time processing and display of data to meet users' demands for quick 
   data access.
2. Concurrency: The project is dedicated to achieving multi-threaded concurrent processing to enhance system performance and response time.
3. Security: Permission control and role management are implemented to ensure data security and privacy protection.
4. Scalability: The design goal includes support for future scalability to accommodate the ever-growing data requirements.
5. User-Friendliness: The system should be user-friendly to ensure effective utilization by a variety of users.
## Deliverables: 
1. A complete high-frequency data processing and display system, including both front-end and back-end components.
2. Archives of source code and documentation to ensure maintainability and scalability of the project.
## System Blocks:
1. Data Collection Module: Responsible for collecting data from various sources and transmitting it to the system.
2. Data Processing Module: Conducts data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation for further analysis and display.
3. Data Presentation Module: Provides a user interface for users to search, view, and analyze data.
4. Multi-threaded Processing Module: Handles concurrent requests to ensure high system performance.
5. Permission Control Module: Manages user permissions to ensure data security.
## Hardware/Software Requirements:
1. Server Hardware: Servers with sufficient processing power and storage capacity.
2. Operating System: An operating system that supports multi-threaded processing, such as Linux or Windows Server.
3. Database: A database system for data storage and management, MySQL 
4. Programming Language: The programming language used for developing the system, Java.
5. Front-end Framework: A front-end framework for building the user interface, such as React or Angular.
6. Security Tools: Security tools for implementing permission control and data encryption.

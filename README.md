# ProjectECE535
## Motivation
This project aims to create a smart urban traffic management system. Predict future traffic conditions by analyzing data and update them to the system in real time to provide convenience for the general public's transportation. This important information will be accessed frequently for a period of time after it is published.
Accessing data using traditional methods will lead to inefficient results, increase system load, and degrade user experience. Therefore, we can consider employing a range of optimization strategies, such as data categorization, multi-level caching, and multi-threaded concurrency, to address this issue.
## Design Goals:
1. Real-time Capability: One of the design goals of the project is to ensure real-time processing and display of data to meet users' demands for quick 
   data access.
2. Concurrency: The project is dedicated to achieving multi-threaded concurrent processing to enhance system performance and response time.
3. Security: Permission control and role management are implemented to ensure data security and privacy protection.
4. Scalability: The design goal includes support for future scalability to accommodate the ever-growing data requirements.
5. User-Friendliness: The system should be user-friendly to ensure effective utilization by a variety of users.
## Deliverables: 
1. A complete high-frequency data processing and display system, including both front-end and back-end components.
2. Archives of source code and documentation to ensure maintainability and scalability of the project.
## System Blocks:
1. Data Collection Module: Responsible for collecting data from various sources and transmitting it to the system.
2. Data Processing Module: Conducts data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation for further analysis and display.
3. Data Presentation Module: Provides a user interface for users to search, view, and analyze data.
4. Multi-threaded Processing Module: Handles concurrent requests to ensure high system performance.
5. Permission Control Module: Manages user permissions to ensure data security.
## Hardware/Software Requirements:
1. Server Hardware: Servers with sufficient processing power and storage capacity.
2. Operating System: An operating system that supports multi-threaded processing, such as Linux or Windows Server.
3. Database: A database system for data storage and management, MySQL 
4. Programming Language: The programming language used for developing the system, Java.
5. Front-end Framework: A front-end framework for building the user interface, such as React or Angular.
6. Security Tools: Security tools for implementing permission control and data encryption.
## Team memberâ€™s lead roles:
